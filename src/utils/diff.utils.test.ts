LAD are ranking up with only 6 strikeouts last game, average 3 total of 6.33 and average total of 8.12(13 out 30)\n\nSafer plays: Ranger Suarez over 5.5 strikeouts vs Reds\n\nRanger has gone over this line 7 out 10 starts, the only 3 times he hasnâ€™t gone over this line was vs guardians which was a hook , vs Brewers where he got hit hard 7 hits and 2 ER, and vs Pirates which got 5 hits and 2 ER and it was hook as well with 5.\nReds are ranked 24 out 30 in strikeouts, last game had 12 , average total 3 of 7.67 and total of 8.72\n\n\n\nRiskier line: Riskier line: Matthew Liberatore over 3.5 strikeouts vs Cubs -175 (9/10)\n\nMatthew has gone over this line in 9 out of his 10 starts, surprised that the books have his line so low , they are expecting the cubs to have a great game like last night, but I canâ€™t seem him not going over this line . Only time he hasnâ€™t gone over this line was vs  second game with royals with 2 strikeouts. He is pitching vs cubs which he already had a game on June 23 and he ended up the game with 5 strikeouts . The cubs are ranking up 7 out 30 in strikeouts , last game they had 5 and average total of 7.78\n\nRiskier line: Jonathan Cannon over 3.5 strikeouts vs Rockies -185`,

WOW.\n\nLAA/TOR - TOR ML (-158) âœ… Sweaty, but we got it.\n\nBAL/ATL - ATL ML (-171) ðŸ¤® Fire the whole coaching staff.

Valdez on the mound for HOU tomorrow against Ohtani who wonâ€™t get more than 3-4 innings.  Dodger bullpen was tonight and they shit the bed. HOU saves their prime bullpen guys for tomorrow as well.\n\nDET/CLE - DET ML (-113) âœ…SHOCKED!  SHOCKED I SAY!  CLE Couldnâ€™t muster more than 1 run. Again.\n\nBOL TODAY and HAPPY 4th!!\n\nRR 2â€™s, 3â€™s and 4â€™s with a 2 unit 6 legger for today. 25 units risk total today with possible payout of 134 units if we sweep. Yesterday was close, but close donâ€™t count. Letâ€™s get it.\n\n4-2 today. Not bad. Dodgers game was strange, but thatâ€™s baseball. \n\nFinal tally in units was -1 unit.  I expected to do a lil better than that, but the inability to hedge LAD ML before they were down 6-1 made a big difference. \n\nNo harm done, on to Saturdays slate. \n\nTODAYS PICKS\n\nSTL/CHC - CHC ML (-135) Pomeranz is opening for Wicks.  Digging into Wicks history before confirming or pulling this pick.  Annnnnnnd weâ€™re back. Wicks has had three outings in Triple A and in 11 innings has given up 7 hits, 2 runs and struck out 16!  Iâ€™m going to lean on STL still being on a slide while CHC is hot.  If STL breaks out today in 3 innings against Wicks then so be it. I do. It expect wicks to go more than 3-4 innings unless he proves VERY effective. Pomeranz will probably only go one and then we get a redemption story in Wicks. Liberatore also has to deal with the CHC lineup seeing him on short turnaround. \nSticking with the pick here.  Oh and the line has moved to -135 CHC FROM -116. \n\nDET/CLE - DET ML (-133) Mize v Allen. CLE will be faded until they prove they can score more than a run or two. DET does enough to take it. \n\nBOS/WAS - Over 9.5 (-125) Combined these teams are 8-2 against the over for this game. Both teams are sending pitchers that give up boat loads of runsâ€¦.probably a trapâ€¦but it shouldnâ€™t be. \n\nHOU/LAD - HOU +1.5 (-170) I actually like HOU to take this game straight up, but Iâ€™ll buy the extra run here. Valdez on the mound and this guy is bananas right now. HOU has won Framberâ€™s last 10 starts in a row. 13 runs in 68 innings in those 10 starts as well.  Ohtani starting for LAD and theyâ€™re in a pinch here. He probably wonâ€™t go more than 3-4 innings tops and LAD bullpen got dinged bad Friday night. Not setting up to be a great series for LAD. \n\nNYY/NYM - NYY ML (-155) Rodon v Montas and I like Rodon to keep the NYM at bay long enough for NYY to plate 2-3 runs or more. Montas just gave up 6 to PIT in his last outing. Gimme them Yankees. \n\n\nWe keep sniffing big winning days here. Braves come back woulda been a big deal, really disappointed  there. LAD game was just nuts. \n\nBOL IF TAILING AS ALWAYS`,
